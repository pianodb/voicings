Chord identification

Assume at most 2 hands


Classification

Cmajor7 can be expressed as:
C+E+G+B

(0)+4+7+11

It is given the canonical ID: 0.4.7.11

Inversions:
When a group of notes can be inverted, pick the one with the most major thirds, then 

Really interesting ones like [0 2 4 5 7] (#28)

D Bb F Bb Ab

normal form in pitch-class set theory

what I called "chroma" is really "pitch class" (which is a note with octave dedupplication)

[ 0  2  5  7  9 10] is a pitch-class set

Is there a database of the relative frequencies of pitch class sets in tonal music?

3. David Temperley’s Statistical Analyses

A Unified Probabilistic Model for Polyphonic Music Analysis
Craig Sapp’s Humdrum / KernScores Database

So what chord:
e a d g b
c f bb eb g

c eb f g bb
